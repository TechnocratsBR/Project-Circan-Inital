This will prompt the GUI in which you can input all the information and update your information. Please note that the program will generate graphs till the previous day's date.

WANT TO START YOUR DATA SET FROM SCRATCH?? To do so, DELETE all the data given in the current 'circanlog.xlsx', except for the column headings (Days, Sleep, Wake..). Close the excel file and run 'Log.py' again. Add some data, and run it.

IMPORTANT NOTES: Please ensure the modules given above are installed. The excel sheet 'Log.xlsx' MUST be closed (not open in any tab) for the program to work. This program is designed to be used by a user ONCE per day. Therefore, in order to add multiple days of data, you must add data of a day, close the GUI, launch it again, and enter the next days data again, and so on.

Besides that,, happy sleep tracking!
